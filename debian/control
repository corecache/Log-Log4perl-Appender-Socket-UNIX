Description: Log::Log4perl::Appender::Socket::UNIX- Log to a Unix Domain Socket
 This is a simple appender for writing to a unix domain socket. It relies on
 Socket and only logs to an existing socket - ie. very useful to always log
 debug streams to the socket. Since the socket is non-blocking, it doesnt
 matter wheter the socket exists or not.
 .
 The appender just _tries_ to stream to a socket. The socket in questions is
 beeing created by the client who wants to listen, once created the messages
 are coming thru.
